# Quality of Activity Classifier

## Background

People that are into tracking their personal data with a Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, Fitbit or whatever activity tracker they use regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do.  However, they rarely quantify the quality of how they conduct these activities. In this project, the goal was to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
